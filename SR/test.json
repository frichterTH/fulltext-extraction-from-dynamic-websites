{"title": "Adlercreutzia rubneri sp. nov., a resveratrol-metabolizing bacterium isolated from human faeces and emended description of the genus Adlercreutzia", "abstract": "The novel, anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterial strain, ResAG-91T, was isolated from a faecal sample of a male human volunteer. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain ResAG-91T showed high similarity to the type strains of Adlercreutzia equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens and Adlercreutzia equolifaciens subsp. celatus. Analysis of the whole draft genome sequences, i.e. digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI), of strain ResAG-91T and the type strains of Adlercreutzia species revealed that strain ResAG-91T represents a novel species of the genus Adlercreutzia. The genome size of strain ResAG-91T is 2.8 Mbp and the G+C content is 63.3 mol%. The major respiratory quinone of strain ResAG-91T was MMK-5 (methylmenaquinone). Major cellular fatty acids were C15 : 0 anteiso, C14 : 0 iso and C14 : 0 2-OH. Galactose and ribose were detected as major whole cell sugars. Furthermore, the peptidoglycan type of strain ResAG-91T was A1γ with meso-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified lipid, three unidentified phospholipids and five unidentified glycolipids. Strain ResAG-91T was able to metabolize the stilbene resveratrol into dihydroresveratrol. On the basis of this polyphasic approach, including phenotypical, molecular (16S rRNA gene and whole genome sequencing) and biochemical (fatty acids, quinones, polar lipids, peptidoglycan, whole cell sugars, Rapid ID32A and API20A) analyses, we propose the novel species Adlercreutzia rubneri sp. nov. with the type and only strain ResAG-91T (=DSM 111416T=JCM 34176T=LMG 31897T).", "paragraph": ["ANI, average nucleotide identity; dDDH, digital DNA–DNA hybridization; DMMK, dimethylmenaquinone; MBHI, modified brain heart infusion; MK, menaquinone; MMK, methylmenaquinone; SEM, scanning electron microscopy.", "In 2008, the genus Adlercreutzia was proposed in honour of Herman Adlercreutz for his contributions to research on the effects of phyto-oestrogens on human health [1]. The genus Adlercreutzia belongs to the family Eggerthellaceae within the class Coriobacteriia (phylum Actinobacteria) [2]. In 2018, Nouioui et al. [3] investigated the phylum Actinobacteria using a genome-based taxonomic approach. At the time of the present writing, the genus Adlercreutzia includes the following species and subspecies: (I) Adlercreutzia caecimuris [4], (II) Adlercreutzia equolifaciens subsp. celatus [5], (III) Adlercreutzia equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens (type species of the genus) [1], (IV) Adlercreutzia mucosicola [6] and (V) Adlercreutzia muris [7]. Adlercreutzia caecicola is not included in the analyses within this paper as the taxonomic position of the type strain of A. caecicola was recently proposed to need revision [8].", "Members of the family Eggerthellaceae have mostly been isolated from the gastrointestinal tract or faecal samples of humans [9, 10], mice [4, 6, 7, 11], rats [5], dogs [12] and sheep [13]. Some strains of this family play an important role in the bioactivation and inactivation of secondary plant metabolites such as digoxin [14], daidzein [1, 5, 6], ellagic acid [15], resveratrol [16] and pyrrolizidine alkaloids [13]. In particular, strains of the genus Adlercreutzia (e.g. A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus do03T, A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens FJC-B9T and A. mucosicola Mt1B8T) are described to metabolize the isoflavone daidzein to the more bioactive S-equol [1, 5, 6]. In addition, A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens FJC-B9T was described to metabolize the stilbene resveratrol into dihydroresveratrol [16].", "Strain ResAG-91T was isolated from a human faecal sample during a trial which aimed to isolate bacterial strains that are able to metabolize trans-resveratrol into dihydroresveratrol and/or lunularin. Within the same trial, the former newly described strains Rubneribacter badeniensis ResAG-85T and Enteroscipio rubneri ResAG-96T were isolated [10]. Therefore, the isolation conditions were the same as described previously [10]. Briefly, strain ResAG-91T was isolated from a fresh faecal sample of a healthy human, moderately obese male volunteer (30 years, body mass index 33.2 kg m−2). All dilutions and cultivation steps were performed at 37 °C under strictly anaerobic conditions, either in an A45 anaerobic workstation (Don Whitley Scientific) under atmospheric conditions of N2/CO2/H2 (80 : 10 : 10) or in Hungate tubes flushed with N2/CO2 (80 : 20). The faecal sample (7.5 g) was mixed with 22.5 ml modified brain heart infusion medium (MBHI). MBHI comprises BHI (Merck) supplemented with 0.5 % yeast extract, 0.05 % l-cysteine monohydrochloride (Roth), 1 mg l−1 resazurin sodium salt, 2.5 mg l−1 haem solution and 2 µg ml−1 vitamin K1 solution (Sigma-Aldrich). After a short period of incubation (10 min, 120 r.p.m., 37 °C), the faecal suspension was centrifuged (10 min, room temperature, 300 g) and 1 ml of the faecal suspension supernatant was inoculated in MBHI (10 ml) supplemented with ampicillin (1 µg ml−1), colistin (5 µg ml−1), chloramphenicol (5 µg ml−1), cholic acid (18 µg ml−1) and trans-resveratrol (trans-3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene; 80 µM). Every 48 h the above-mentioned supplements (antibiotics, cholic acid and trans-resveratrol) were added. Samples were serially diluted with PBS and plated onto MBHI agar plates with the same supplements as mentioned above. Strain ResAG-91T was isolated after 72 h, subcultured after 12 days of growth on MBHI agar plates at 37 °C and streaked repeatedly until purity.", "After 48–72 h (strictly anaerobic conditions, 37 °C), strain ResAG-91T occurred as very small (Ø ≈ 1 mm), pale white, semi-translucent colonies. Optical density in liquid media was visually determined using McFarland standards (bioMérieux). Growth in MBHI was slow and similar to McFarland 0.5 at 48 h. Mid-exponential to stationary phase cells were visualized under a phase-contrast microscope (Leica) and occurred as non-motile, very small rods (singly or in short chains). Routine microbiological tests (i.e. Gram-staining, oxidase and catalase activity) using standard techniques showed that strain ResAG-91T was Gram-positive, oxidase-negative and catalase-negative.", "For comparative analysis, the following type strains were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ): A. caecimuris DSM 21839T, A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T, A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens DSM 19450T, A. mucosicola DSM 19490T, A. muris DSM 29508T and Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243T.", "For characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), all five type strains of the genus Adlercreutzia and strain ResAG-91T were grown on MBHI agar plates for 3 days (37 °C, strictly anaerobic conditions). Strains were fixed, dehydrated, dried and mounted on aluminium stubs as described previously [10]. SEM imaging was carried out by using a Quanta 250 FEG scanning electron microscope (FEI) with an Everhart-Thornley detector in high vacuum mode (0.0003 Pa) and an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The rod-shaped morphology of strain ResAG-91T was confirmed by SEM (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, we confirmed the rod-shaped morphology of A. caecimuris DSM 21839T (Fig. 1b), A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T (Fig. 1c), A. mucosicola DSM 19490T (Fig. 1e) and A. muris DSM 29508T (Fig. 1f). In the original strain description, the morphology of A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens DSM 19450T was described as coccobacilli [1], but here we clearly could show the rod-shaped morphology (Fig. 1d). The cell lengths and diameters of 50 cells of strain ResAG-91T and the type strains of Adlercreutzia species were measured using ObjectJ in ImageJ 1.53c [17]. The mean length and mean diameter of strain cells of ResAG-91T were 1.29±0.33 and 0.31±0.04 µm, respectively (Table S1, available in the online version of this article). In addition, data for the cell length and diameter of the type strains of Adlercreutzia species are given in Table S1.", "", "", "The biochemical characteristics of strain ResAG-91T were determined using Rapid ID 32A and API 20A test strips (bioMérieux) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For comparative analysis the five type strains of the genus Adlercreutzia were also tested. After 48 h, the type strains of the genus Adlercreutzia (i.e. DSM 21839T, DSM 18785T, DSM 19450T, DSM 19490T, DSM 29508T) and strain ResAG-91T tested with API 20A showed no metabolic reaction. The results of Rapid ID 32A tests are listed in Table 1 if at least one strain gave a positive result for a specific substrate. All strains were negative for urease, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, β-galactosidase 6-phosphate, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-arabinosidase, β-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, mannose fermentation, raffinose fermentation, α-fucosidase, nitrate reduction, indole production, alkaline phosphatase and glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase. Strain ResAG-91T was capable of producing arginine dihydrolase and showed a weak reaction for the production of arginine arylamidase and leucine arylamidase. The production of arginine dihydrolase and production of arginine arylamidase seems to be a common characteristic of the genus Adlercreutzia.", "A bile-tolerant characteristic (growth with 20 % bile) was described for the type strain of A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus [5]. In addition, sensitivity against bile was described for the type strain of A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens at a concentration of 20 % [1] whereas bile sensitivity at a concentration at 0.5 % bile was reported for the type strains of A. mucosicola [6] and A. caecimuris [4]. We investigated the bile tolerance of strain ResAG-91T and the type strains of the genus Adlercreutzia according to Nagai et al. [18] except that MBHI agar was used. Briefly, strains were plated on MBHI agar with and without ox-bile (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 2 % (w/v). Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243T was used as a bile-resistant positive control [19]. After 5 days of incubation at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions, well grown colonies of all tested strains including strain ResAG-91T were observed at concentrations of 2 % (w/v) ox-bile (Table 1).", "Analyses of respiratory quinones, fatty acids, whole cell sugars, peptidoglycan structure and polar lipids of strains ResAG-91T, A. muris DSM 29508T and A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T were carried out by the Identification Service of the DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany). For this, the biomass of liquid cultures (MBHI, 37 °C, strictly anaerobic conditions) of strains ResAG-91T (24.3 L), A. muris DSM 29508T (36.9 L) and A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T (27.0 L) were collected by centrifugation (9622 g; 10 min; 4 °C) and the total moist biomass of strains ResAG-91T (6.45 g), A. muris DSM 29508T (3.94 g) and A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T (4.50 g) was sent to the DSMZ. Ribose, galactose and minor amounts of glucose were detected as whole cell sugars in cells of strain ResAG-91T. The results of whole cell sugar analysis of strain ResAG-91T in comparison with the type strains of the genus Adlercreutzia are shown in Table 1. Polar lipids in strain ResAG-91T consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, one unidentified lipid, three unidentified phospholipids and five unidentified glycolipids (Fig. S1). The major fatty acids of strain ResAG-91T were C15 : 0 anteiso (40.59 %), C14 : 0 iso (14.95 %) and C14 : 0 2-OH (12.58 %). A list of the fatty acids of strain ResAG-91T, A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T, A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens DSM 19450T and A. muris DSM 29508T is given in Table S2 as these strains were cultivated and analysed under the same conditions. The following respiratory quinones were detected in strain ResAG-91T (Table 1): MMK-5 (methylmenaquinone; 94.9 %), MMK-6 (2.9 %) DMMK-5 (dimethylmenaquinone; 0.9 %), MK-6 (menaquinone; 0.6 %), DMMK-6 (0.5 %) and MK-5 (0.3 %). Table 1 shows the major menaquinones of strain ResAG-91T and the type strains of the genus Adlercreutzia. Predominant respiratory quinones were MMK-5 (menamethylquinone) or MMK-6. The peptidoglycan type of strain ResAG-91T was A1γ with meso-diaminopimelic acid. This peptidoglycan type was reported for the majority of the type strains of Adlercreutzia species (Table 1).", "Strain ResAG-91T was investigated for its ability to metabolize trans-resveratrol into dihydroresveratrol: strain ResAG-91T was incubated in MBHI liquid medium with trans-resveratrol (78.125 µM) at 37 °C under strictly anaerobic conditions in Hungate tubes. At 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, an aliquot (500 µl) was taken and stored at −80 °C. For HPLC with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis, a 200 µl sample was extracted three times with 500 µl ethyl acetate/2-propanol/1-butanol (90:5:5, by vol.). The combined extracts were evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and the residue was resolved in 200 µl of 0.1 % aqueous formic acid/methanol/acetonitrile (90:5:5, by vol.). The sample was filtrated using a syringe filter (PTFE, 0.2 µm, 4 mm; Phenomenex) and analysed by HPLC-DAD (Prominence system; Shimdazu) with LC conditions as described previously [16] and small alteration for the gradient (0–2 min isocratic with 15 % B, 2–11 min from 15 to 23 % B, 11–20.5 min isocratic with 23 % B, 20.5–31 min from 23 to 56 % B, 31–33 min from 56 to 100 % B, 33–36 min isocratic with 100 % B, 36–40 min from 100 to 15 % B, and 40–48 min isocratic at the initial conditions). To monitor the analytes, the trace at 250 nm was used. The identity of analytes was confirmed by the retention time and the UV–Vis spectra. To ensure proper analysis, negative controls (incubation of trans-resveratrol without strain ResAG-91T) as well as blanks (strain ResAG-91T incubated in MBHI liquid medium with DMSO) were measured together with the study samples. After 24 h, dihydroresveratrol was detected in samples previously inoculated with strain ResAG-91T and trans-resveratrol. This result was confirmed by an independent second experiment.", "For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, isolation of bacterial DNA of strain ResAG-91T, 16S rRNA gene amplification and analysis were carried out as described previously [10]. Briefly, the bacterial DNA was isolated using the Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and the almost complete 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primers 16Sseq fw (5′-ATAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 16Sseq rev (5′-GGNTACCTTGTTACGACTTC-3′). The 16S rRNA gene sequence (1394 bp, GenBank accession number MH553318) of strain ResAG-91T was used for blastn searches. Strain ResAG-91T was identified as a member of the genus Adlercreutzia and showed the highest similarity to A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens DSM 19450T. Fig. 2 shows a maximum-likelihood tree (BioNumerics, version 7.6; Applied Maths) based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of closely related validly published type strains of the family Eggerthellaceae. Comparable to the blastn analysis, the nearest neighbours of strain ResAG-91T were the type strains of A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens and A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus (Fig. 2). The cluster analysis was repeated with two additional clustering methods, namely neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony, and confirmed the taxonomic position of strain ResAG-91T (Figs S2 and S3).", "", "", "The whole draft genome sequences of strains ResAG-91T (GenBank accession no. WPOO00000000), A. equolifaciens subsp. celatus DSM 18785T (QICA00000000) and A. muris DSM 29508T (WAJS00000000) were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq by our group and published previously [20–22]. Characteristics of the genome sequences of strain ResAG-91T and all type strains of Adlercreutzia (e.g. genome size, G+C content and number of proteins) were obtained by the Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) [23] and are summarized in Table 2. The genome sizes, G+C content and number of proteins of Adlercreutzia species ranged from 2.76 to 3.01 Mbp, 63.1 to 65.1 mol% G+C and 2171 to 2455 proteins, respectively. The genome characteristics of strain ResAG-91T, with a length of 2.80 Mbp, 63.3 mol% G+C and 2369 proteins, were comparable to those of the type strains of Adlercreutzia species. In addition to basic genome characteristics, the results of digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) calculated as OrthoANIu values are included in Table 2. The dDDH values of strain ResAG-91T in comparison to the type strains of Adlercreutzia species were below the 70 % threshold for species delimitation [24, 25] (Table 2). The highest similarity was observed between strain ResAG-91T and the type strain of A. equolifaciens subsp. equolifaciens with a dDDH value of 55.4 %. The OrthoANIu of strain ResAG-91T compared to the type strains of Adlercreutzia species was calculated using the ANI calculator provided by EZBioCloud (https://www.ezbiocloud.net/tools/ani) [26, 27]. All OrthoANIu values of strain ResAG-91T compared to the type strains of Adlercreutzia species were below the 95–96% cut-off value for species delimitation [28].", "Fig. 3 shows a phylogenomic tree of strain ResAG-91T and the type strains of Adlercreutzia species. Eggerthella lenta DSM 2243T was used as an outgroup. The tree was calculated using the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC; version 3.6.9, www.patricbrc.org) [29] and the RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) algorithm [30]. Bacterial species, strain number, GenBank accession and the PATRIC Genome ID of all genomes selected for phylogenetic comparison are given in Table S3 while the tree analysis statistics are listed in Table S4. For sufficient phylogenomic treeing, the involved minimum number of 31 genes is proposed [31]. To calculate the tree in Fig. 3, 378 coding gene sequences were used and the tree was built on protein alignments based on single-copy homology groups.
