# fulltext-extraction-from-dynamic-websites
Full text (articles) extraction from dynamic websites using a web scraping approach.

I have started a few attempts and so far i have gotten the farthest with the article_spider.
The articles in IJSEM are loaded dynamically without using json.
The tutorials I have found so far focus exclusively on json but I will continue to research in that direction.

The problem I see after that is the individual file paths/URLs that lead to the source of the article content,
so I need to find a way to read these to generalize the process if possible.
