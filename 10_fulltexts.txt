The genus Aliidiomarina belongs to the family Idiomarinaceae, order Alteromonadales, class Gammaproteobacteria. This genus has two sister genera named Idiomarina and Pseudidiomarina in the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature. Despite the reclassification of the genus Pseudidiomarina into the genus Idiomarina, the species of both genera could not be distinguished from each other using phenotypic or chemotaxonomic characteristics, and recently the genus Pseudidiomarina was reinstated following the results of genome-based analysis. The genus Aliidiomarina was close to the genus Pseudidiomarina in the phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rRNA genes. However, it is distant from both sister genera in the phylogenomic tree based on the 78 core genes. At the time of writing, a total of ten species of this genus were validly published, including Aliidiomarina taiwanensis, Aliidiomarina haloalkalitolerans, Aliidiomarina shirensis, Aliidiomarina minuta, Aliidiomarina iranensis, Aliidiomarina sanyensis, Aliidiomarina soli, Aliidiomarina maris, Aliidiomarina celeris and Aliidiomarina sedimenti. These species were isolated from a wide variety of habitats, including seawater, saline lakes, coastal-marine wetland, Spirulina platensis cultivation pool, soil and sediments. Members of the genus Aliidiomarina are Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, aerobic and require sodium ions for growth. The major isoprenoid quinone is ubiquinone-8, and iso-branched fatty acids including iso-C17  :  0, summed feature 9 (comprising iso-C17  :  1ω9c and/or 10-methyl C16  :  0) and iso-C15  :  0 are the major cellular fatty acid components. This article describes a haloalkaliphilic strain isolated from a soda lake. The strain is proposed as a novel species of the genus Aliidiomarina. Strain IM 1326T was isolated from a brine sample of a soda lake (Hutong Qagan Lake) from the Ordos, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China, in July 2017. The sampling site was located at the position of 39° 12′ 14″ N, 109° 0′ 8″ E, and an altitude of 1250 m. The total salinity of the lake water was 26%, while the pH was 9.95. The brine sample was stored in a sterilized plastic bottle and transported to the laboratory at ambient temperature. The sample was incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks after being inoculated in LN liquid medium (originally designed for microbe using light by refering neutral oligotrophic medium) composed of (per litre): 15.0 g NaCl, 0.5 g yeast extract (Difco), 6.0 g NaHCO3, 4.0 g Na2CO3, 0.2 g NH4Cl, 2.0 g KCl, 0.25 g fish peptone, 0.38 g sodium formate, 0.25 g sodium acetate, 0.25 g sodium pyruvate, 1.0 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.08 g CaCl2, 56 mg FeSO4·7H2O, and pH was adjusted to 9.5 with 1 M NaOH. The enrichment culture was spread on agar plates of the same medium (15.0 g agar per litre) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days. Pure cultures were obtained by repeated subculturing of a single colony on the same solid medium. A circular, convex and light brown colony was obtained on LN plates after 5 days of incubation at 37 °C. The strain was routinely cultured at 37 °C in LN medium. Stock culture of the isolate was preserved in LN medium with 20 % glycerol (v/v) at −80 °C. The phylogenetic position of strain IM 1326T was determined through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was amplified using oligonucleotide primers complementary to highly conserved regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The forward and reverse primers were 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′), respectively. The amplified product was cloned in the pMD-18T vector (Takara), and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli JM109 (BioMed) cells. Sanger sequencing was performed by Witon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, PR China). Sequences were preliminarily analysed by the blast program (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the EzBioCloud webserver (www.ezbiocloud.net), and the closely related sequences were selected as references from the list of hits with valid names. The maximum-likelihood, neighbour-joining, minimum-evolution and maximum-parsimony methods were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees in mega 6.0 software. The robustness of the phylogenetic tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap analyses based on 1000 replicates. This study determined the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence (1503 bp) of strain IM 1326T. The similarities between strain IM 1326T and the most closely related species A. sanyensis, A. shirensis, A. iranensis, A. haloalkalitolerans, A. celeris, A. minuta and A. taiwanensis (the type species of this genus) were 95.8, 95.7, 95.4, 95.3, 95.0, 94.7 and 93.6%, respectively. In the maximum-likelihood tree, strain IM 1326T fell within a clade comprising species of the genus Aliidiomarina. The subclade was composed of A. taiwanensis AIT1T, A. sanyensis GYP-17T, and A. haloalkalitolerans AK5T (Fig. 1). Considering the low bootstrap values (not shown if less than 70%), the topology of the phylogenetic tree was not stable. The topology and phylogenetic relationship were also supported by the neighbour-joining, minimum-evolution and maximum-parsimony phylogenetic trees (Figs S1–S3, available in the online version of this article). In addition, the genera Pseudidiomarina and Idiomarina were closer in most phylogenetic trees (Figs 1, S1 and S2), apart from the maximum-parsimony tree (Fig. S3). Moreover, the bootstrap values were lower than 70 % between the genus Aliidiomarina and the clade of the genera Pseudidiomarina and Idiomarina. This finding is different from the previous report using FastTree with JTT+CAT parameters. Altogether, strain IM 1326T was likely to represent a novel species of the genus Aliidiomarina. The draft genome of strain IM 1326T was sequenced by Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, PR China) for genome-level phylogenetic analysis. Briefly, the genomic DNA was extracted using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method, and purity was ascertained using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). After the construction of the DNA library, the genome was sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq platform. Genome assembly was carried out using SPAdes version 3.13.0. The draft genome sequence has been deposited with accession number VJWL00000000 in the GenBank of the NCBI nucleotide database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome) and annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline version 4.7 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_prok/). DNA G+C content and other detailed information were obtained from the genome sequence. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) percentages with other species of the genus Aliidiomarina were calculated using the blast (ANIb) and MUMmer (ANIm) algorithms from the JSpecies Web Server (http://jspecies.ribohost.com/jspeciesws). The average amino acid identity (AAI) values were calculated using the online tool ANI/AAI-Matrix (http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/g-matrix/), a genome-based distance matrix calculator. In addition, genome-to-genome distance analysis via digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) was performed with the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (http://ggdc.dsmz.de/distcalc2.php) using the method described by Meier-Kolthoff et al.. Furthermore, a phylogenomic tree was reconstructed based on 120 bacterial conserved single-copy genes obtained by employing the Genome Taxonomy Database. Genome sequencing of strain IM 1326T resulted in raw data of 3.06 Gb with 1189× genome coverage. Sequence reads were de novo assembled into 19 contigs and 12 scaffolds. The genomic size was 2.57 Mb. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain IM 1326T was estimated to be 49.7 mol%, which was similar to that of other species of the genus Aliidiomarina (46.3–52.1 mol%) and slightly higher than that of A. taiwanensis AIT1T (48.7 mol%), the type species of the genus Aliidiomarina (Table 1). The detailed genomic information is presented in Table S1. The value of genome relatedness between strain IM 1326T and its closely related species ranged from 68.1 to 72.6 % for ANIb, 80.7 to 84.9 % for ANIm, 76 to 78 % for AAI, and 16.2 to 22.7 % for dDDH (Table 2). The percentage similarity values with A. sanyensis GYP-17T, the most closely related species, were 72.6 % for ANIb, 83.5 % for ANIm, 78 % for AAI, and 18.4 % for dDDH. The obtained similarity percentage values are lower than the standard thresholds for species delineation, i.e., 95 % for ANI, 95 % for AAI and 70 % for dDDH. The maximum-likelihood phylogenomic tree reconstruction based on 120 bacterial conserved single-copy genes revealed that strain IM 1326T was located in the Aliidiomarina clade and separated from other species (Fig. 2). The bootstrap value between strain IM 1326T and A. sanyensis GYP-17T was 100%, suggesting it was a novel species of Aliidiomarina. The neighbour-joining, minimum-evolution and maximum-parsimony phylogenomic trees displayed similar phylogenetic positions (Figs S4–S6). In addition, the phylogenomic trees based on 120 bacterial conserved single-copy proteins agreed with the tree based on the 78 concatenated core protein sequences of the family Idiomarinaceae. Therefore, the results confirmed that IM 1326T represents a novel species in the genus Aliidiomarina. The type species of the genus Aliidiomarina, A. taiwanensis CGMCC 1.15255T (=AIT1T, obtained from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center), and A. haloalkalitolerans DSM 24939T (=AK5T, obtained from the Leibniz Institute German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) were selected as reference species to compare physiological characteristics and fatty acid compositions. A. taiwanensis CGMCC 1.15255T and A. haloalkalitolerans DSM 24939T were cultured using marine broth medium 2216E at 30 °C. The physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain IM 1326T were examined by using routine cultivation methods on HM medium containing (g l−1): NaCl (30.0), KCl (2.0), MgSO4·7H2O (1.0), NaBr (0.23), CaCl2 (0.27), NaHCO3 (0.06), FeCl3 (trace), tryptone (5.0), yeast extract (10.0) and agar (15.0 for solid medium) at 37 °C and pH adjusted to pH 8.5 before sterilization. The Gram staining analysis was performed according to the method described by Dussault. Morphology and cell size of the cells were observed under a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi H-700A). Motility was observed using an Olympus BX 51 microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics. The flagellum was observed under a transmission electron microscope. The temperature range for growth was determined at 1, 4, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, 37, 40, 42, 45 and 50 °C in HM medium containing 3 % (w/v) NaCl at pH 9.0. The salinity range for growth was observed with 0–15.0 % (w/v) NaCl at intervals of 1.0 % (w/v). After the identification of the optimum salinity, NaCl concentration was changed to 4 % (w/v). The pH range for growth was determined from pH 5.0 to 12.0 at intervals of 0.5 pH units using the following buffers (25 mM concentration): MES (for pH 5.0–6.0), PIPES (pH 6.5–7.0), HEPES (pH 6.8–8.0), Tricine (pH 7.4–8.8), CHES (pH 8.6–10.0) and CAPS (pH 9.7–12.0). Anaerobic growth was tested in the presence of 5.0 % (w/v) nitrate, 3.0 % (w/v) l-arginine and 5.0 % (v/v) DMSO in stoppered tubes. Tests for catalase and oxidase activities and the hydrolysis of starch, gelatin, casein, and Tweens 20, 40, 60, and 80 were carried out using routine cultivation methods on HM medium with 4 % (w/v) NaCl as described by Harrigan et al.. H2S formation was detected using a filter-paper strip impregnated with lead acetate. Indole production from tryptophan, the utilization of sugars and organic acids, and the Voges–Proskauer test were assessed as described by Oren et al.. In brief, the utilization of sole carbon and energy sources was detected using minimal medium (tryptone was omitted and yeast extract was decreased to 1 g l−1) with various supplementary carbon sources and then comparing the cell density. Acid production from sugars and alcohols was determined, and the substrates used were d-glucose, d-galactose, sucrose, d-sorbitol, mannose, maltose, starch, d-fructose, l-sorbose, ribose, trehalose, d-xylose and glycerol. Production of acid from the above-mentioned carbohydrates and sugar alcohols was tested on the growth medium supplemented with 10.0 g l−1 of the substrate. The pH of the cultures was measured with a glass electrode at the end of the incubation period and compared with the initial pH and the pH of the control tube without substrate. Reduction of nitrate and nitrite were detected by using sulfanilic acid and α-naphthylamine reagent. All tests were performed in triplicate along with the reference species under identical conditions. Strain IM 1326T was Gram-stain-negative. The cells were approximately 0.3–0.6 µm wide and 0.8–2.1 µm long (Fig. S7). The isolate can move, but no flagellum was observed under the transmission electron microscope (Fig. S8). Furthermore, the type of motility was explored. There were no rafts of cells and isolated cells were observed in the microscope image of the edge of colonies (Fig. S9), indicating that the cells did not move by gliding; therefore, further exploration is necessary. The colonies were light brown when grown on HM medium (pH 8.5) for 24 h at 37 °C. Strain IM 1326T was able to grow in presence of 0–13.0 % NaCl concentration (optimum, 4.0–6.0 %), at 4–42 °C (optimum, 37 °C) and pH 7.5–11.0 (optimum, pH 9.0–10.0). Moreover, it showed more tolerance to alkalinity (up to pH 11.0) than most of the reference species. Strain IM 1326T could hydrolyse gelatin, casein and different kinds of Tweens, e.g. Tween 20, 40 and 60, but could not hydrolyse starch. In addition, strain IM 1326T was positive for nitrate reduction, but negative for nitrite reduction. Cells of strain IM 1326T were oxidase- and catalase-positive. Correspondingly, a respiratory nitrate reductase operon (including four genes FM042_RS01865 to FM042_RS01880), NarK family nitrate/nitrite transporter (FM042_RS01935) and catalase (FM042_RS03320 and FM042_RS09450) were annotated in the genome. However, the draft genome did not contain the gene for amylase and nitrite reduction. Strain IM 1326T could produce H2S from cysteine but did not produce indole from tryptophan. The detailed morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of strain IM 1326T are provided in the species description and Table 1. Cells grown on HM plates for 2 days at 37 °C were harvested for the cellular fatty acid analysis. The fatty acids were extracted according to the standard midi protocol (Sherlock Microbial Identification System, version 6.0). The cellular fatty acid profiles of strain IM 1326T, A. taiwanensis CGMCC 1.15255T and A. haloalkalitolerans DSM 24939T are shown in Table S2. The predominant fatty acids detected in strain IM 1326T were 10-methyl-C16 : 0/iso-C17 : 1 ω9c (summed feature 9, 22.2 %), iso-C15 : 0 (16.1 %) and iso-C17 : 0 (13.1 %). These are also the dominant fatty acids in the two reference strains. In addition, we observed that, contrary to the original report, the content of C16 : 0 was high (up to 13.2 %) in A. taiwanensis CGMCC 1.15255T. However, the amount of C16 : 0 was lower in IM 1326T and A. haloalkalitolerans DSM24939T (Table S2). These data on the fatty acids composition of two reference species were similar to the previous report. Despite the divergence in results from the different labs, all three species contained the major fatty acids of the genus Aliidiomarina. Polar lipids of strain IM 1326T were extracted by a phenol–chloroform system and analysed by using two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) as described previously. Merck silica gel 60 F254 aluminum-backed thin-layer plates were used for the TLC analysis. The first and second dimensional TLC solvents were chloroform–methanol–water (65 : 25 : 4, by vol.) and chloroform–methanol–acetate–water (80 : 12 : 15 : 4, by vol.), respectively. The reagent sulfuric acid–ethanol (1 : 1, v/v) was used to detect total polar lipids. According to the TLC chromatogram, the major polar lipids of strain IM 1326T were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and one unidentified aminophospholipid (Fig. S10). The polar lipid composition of two reference species (including the type species) were identified under identical experimental condition (Fig. S10). Most of the Aliidiomarina species contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine (Table 1). The above findings are in unison with the polar lipid compositions of the genus Aliidiomarina. Respiratory quinones were extracted from lyophilized cells, and the extracts were purified by TLC and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography according to the method of Collins. Strain IM 1326T contained ubiquinone-8 as the sole respiratory quinone (Table 1). However, a minor quinone of the genus Aliidiomarina ubiquinone-9 was not detected. Consequently, on the basis of the phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic data, strain IM 1326T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Aliidiomarina, for which the name Aliidiomarina halalkaliphila sp. nov. is proposed. Aliidiomarina halalkaliphila (hal.al.ka.li’phi.la. Gr. masc. n. hals halos salt; N.L. n. alkali alkali; Gr. masc. adj. philus friend, loving; N.L. fem. adj. halalkaliphila salt and alkali-loving). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, motile, rod-shaped, approximately 0.3–0.6 µm wide and 0.8–2.1 µm long. Colonies grown for 24 h at 37 °C on HM medium are circular, smooth, convex, light brown and approximately 1.0–3.0 mm in diameter. Oxidase and catalase are positive. Growth occurs at 4–45 °C (optimum, 37 °C), at pH 7.5–11.0 (optimum, pH 9.0–10.0) and with 0–13.0 % (w/v) NaCl concentration (optimum 4.0–6.0 %). Anaerobic and microaerobic growth does not occur on HM medium with or without nitrate. Nitrate is reduced, but nitrite is not. H2S is produced from cysteine. Production of indole and utilization of urea does not occur. The methyl red reaction is negative, but the Voges–Proskauer test result is positive. Gelatin, casein, DNA and Tweens 20, 40 and 60 are hydrolysed, but Tween 80, aesculin and starch are not hydrolysed. The following substrates are utilized as single carbon and energy sources for growth: l-arginine, l-lactate, l-glutamate, acetate, l-malate, pyruvate, succinate, citrate, l-serine, glycine, valine and histidine. The following substrates are not utilized as sole sources of carbon and energy: d-glucose, d-galactose, sucrose, d-sorbitol, fumarate, l-aspartate, mannose, maltose, starch, l-alanine, l-ornithine, d-fructose, l-sorbose, ribose, trehalose, d-xylose, glycerol and l-lysine. No acids are produced with the following substrates: d-glucose, d-galactose, sucrose, d-sorbitol, mannose, maltose, starch, d-fructose, l-sorbose, ribose, trehalose, d-xylose and glycerol. The respiratory quinone is ubiquinone-8. The major cellular fatty acids of the isolate are 10-methyl-C16 : 0/iso-C17 : 1 ω9c (summed feature 9), iso-C15 : 0 and iso-C17 : 0. The major polar lipids include diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and one unidentified aminophospholipid. The type strain, IM 1326T (=CGMCC 1.17056T=JCM 34227T), was isolated from the soda lake Hutong Qagan Lake in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. The genomic size of the type strain is 2.57 Mb, and DNA G+C content is 49.7 mol% (determined from the genome sequence). This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91751201) and the Science and Technology Basic Resources Investigation Project (No. 2017FY100300). The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

The genus Mameliella was proposed by Zheng et al. in 2010, with Mameliella alba as the type species. In 2021, the ‘Roseobacter clade’ of the family Rhodobacteraceae was validly published as the family Roseobacteraceae, therefore the genus Mameliella was moved to the family Roseobacteraceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria. In 2015, four heterotypic synonyms of Mameliella alba, Mameliella phaeodactyli, Mameliella atlantica, Ponticoccus lacteus and Alkalimicrobium pacificum, have been published independently, because the chimaeric 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain JLT354-WT (EU734592.1) had been submitted to the GenBank database. After identification of this mistake, by January 2022, the genus Mameliella contains only one species with a correct validly published name according to List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/mameliella). During a course of study on the poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate-producing marine bacteria from Daya Bay, Guangdong, PR China, we isolated a novel bacterial strain resembling members of the genus Mameliella, designated DP3N28-2T. Using PCR with specific primers, we identified that DP3N28-2T had a poly-β-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymerase (phaC) gene (gel profile data not shown), which indicated the potential for producing PHA. Therefore, in this study, we were aimed to determine the exact taxonomic position of DP3N28-2T, by using a polyphasic approach based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic data, and estimated the PHA-producing ability of the genus Mameliella. The novel isolate of a member of the genus Mameliella was isolated from a surface sediment sample near off-shore sewage outfall (22°34′19.57″ N, 114°30′29.33″ E) from 5.3 m depth. The sediment sample was incubated in medium containing 5 g (w/w) peptone and 1 g (w/w) yeast extract per litre sea water, at 30 °C for 28 days, and then isolated using the standard dilution plating technique on marine agar (MA; Haibo). After purification by re-streaking, the novel strain was routinely cultivated at 30 °C on MA and stored at −80 °C in sterile 15 % (v/v) glycerol supplemented with 1 % (w/v) saline. The reference type strain, M. alba CGMCC 1.7209T, were procured from the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Centre. Both strains could form single colonies on MA within 24 h at 30 °C. To standardize the culture conditions in this study, we cultivated M. alba CGMCC 1.7209T using MA or MB. The 16S rRNA gene of DP3N28-2T was amplified by PCR with the universal primers 27F and 1492R, and sequenced by Sangon (Shanghai, PR China). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of DP3N28-2T was analysed by using the blast programme (NCBI) and compared with closely related sequences of reference organisms using the service from EzBioCloud (www.ezbiocloud. net). Alignments of 16S rRNA gene sequences were performed using the programme clustal_x, version 1.81, and positions with insertions or deletions were excluded during calculations. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum-parsimony (MP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods with the mega 7 programme package. The NJ tree and ML tree were reconstructed using evolutionary distances that were calculated with the Kimura two-parameter model with Gamma distribution. The MP tree was obtained using the subtree-pruning–regrafting algorithm. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The stability of the clusters was evaluated by bootstrap analysis based on 1000 replicates. A nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of DP3N28-2T obtained by amplification (1303 bp) was included in the 16S rRNA gene sequence assembled from genomic sequences (1437 bp). On the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence (from genome sequence), strain DP3N28-2T was closely related to Mameliella alba DSM 23384T (98.3%), Antarctobacter jejuensis 13–2-B6T (97.2%), Antarctobacter heliothermus El-219T (96.8%), Maliponia aquimaris MM-10T (96.7%), Ponticoccus litoralis CL-GR66T (96.4%) and Aquicoccus porphyridii L1 8-17T (96.1%). In the NJ, MP and ML phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1), although the distance between DP3N28-2T and M. alba was the shortest, they did not cluster together. Therefore, a genome-based phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the Type (Strain) Genome Server provided by DSMZ to further verify the phylogenetic position. This tree indicated that DP3N28-2T formed a clade with the type strain of M. alba (Fig. 2), which indicated that DP3N28-2T could represent a novel species of the genus Mameliella. The draft genome of DP3N28-2T was sequenced using a HiSeq X-ten platform (Illumina), assembled at Guangdong Magigene Biotechnology. (Guangdong, PR China; http://www.magigene.com/) using the SPAdes software (v3.13.0) and annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. The assembled genome of DP3N28-2T (JAHUZG000000000) had a total length of 5 120 735 bp, coverage of 600×, contig N50 value of 1 507 360 bp, 4966 predicted gene sequences and 54 RNAs. The final assembly contained 21 contigs and a had a DNA G+C content of 63.0 mol%. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) using the OrthoANI algorithm and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values was obtained to determine the genetic relatedness between DP3N28-2T and the type species M. alba CGMCC 1.7290T (FMZI01000000). ANI and dDDH (formula 2) were 81.1 and 23.4 %, respectively. They were both lower than the threshold value for species demarcation (ANI, 95–96 %; dDDH, 70 %). Furthermore, the difference in DNA G+C content between DP3N28-2T and the type species was 2.2 mol%, which indicated that they represented two different species. Therefore, on the basis of the results of the phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values and the genomic sequence similarity values, DP3N28-2T was considered to represent a novel species of the genus Mameliella. All morphological and physiological features of DP3N28-2T were examined after incubation in MB or on MA at 30 °C for 24 h to a maximum of 1 week unless otherwise specified. Cell morphology, Gram-staining and motility were determined by microscopy (CX43, Olympus) and transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 F30, FEI). Cells of DP3N28-2T were Gram-stain-negative non-flagellated and rod shaped. The cell length was 1.3–4.7 µm and the width was 0.5–0.9 µm (Fig. S1, available in the online version of this article). The shape varied due to the distribution of the PHA granules. Growth of DP3N28-2T and M. alba CGMCC 1.7290T was tested at 4, 8, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 37, 40, 45 and 50 °C, NaCl concentrations in the range of 0–10 % (w/v; at increments of 1 %) and pH values in the range of 4.0–12.0 (at intervals of 1.0 pH unit) adjusted using HCl or NaOH. The growth was measured using OD600 after 24, 48 and 96 h. Growth occurred at temperatures from 15 to 45 °C (optimally at 37–40 °C), pH from 5.0 to 8.0 (optimally at pH 6.0) and NaCl concentrations from 0–10 % (optimally at 4 %). No growth observed after incubation in an anaerobic chamber on MA for 2 weeks. Oxidase activity was determined using a bioMérieux oxidase reagent kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Catalase activity was tested by bubble production using 3 % (v/v) H2O2 solution. Utilization of citrate, pyruvate and malonate as sole carbon sources was determined. DP3N28-2T was cultivated in the minimal salt medium containing, per litre of distilled water: 2.28 g K2HPO4·3H2O, 1.32 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.47 g NaHPO4, supplemented with 1 % carbon source. Hydrolysis of agar and starch, H2S production, reduction of nitrate, Voges–Proskauer test, methyl red test and indole production were investigated according to the methods described by Dong and Cai. The phenotypic characterization was carried out using API 20NE, API ZYM (bioMérieux) and GEN III MicroPlate (Biolog) on DP3N28-2T and the reference type strain independently twice without replicates at 30 °C. The polyhydroxyalkanoates production of DP3N28-2T was examined as described by Juengert et al. using gas chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu) with GC column DB-WAX (G6501-CTC, Agilent Technologies). DP3N28-2T exhibited phenotypic similarities to M. alba CGMCC 1.7290T, including being Gram-stain-negative, rod shaped, aerobic, having positive reactions for catalase and oxidase and identical reactions in API ZYM tests, except for α-galactosidase. Both strains could accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate. The GC result indicated that DP3N28-2T and M. alba CGMCC 1.7290T accumulated PHA up to 12.3±2.9 % and 19.2±5.8 % (per dry cell weight, ±standard deviation), respectively. In the genomic data, the PHA synthase gene (phaC), PHA depolymerase gene (phaZ), regulator gene (phaR) and PHA granule-associated phasin gene (phaP) were annotated (accession numbers are listed in Table S1). On the basis of the data obtained during this study, we could distinguish DP3N28-2T from M. alba in various ways (Table 1). However, the reported phenotypic features of M. alba were highly variable among the five representatives, for example the optimal NaCl (w/v, %) of M. alba JLT354-WT was 1–3 while that of A. pacificum F15T was 3.5, from which we could draw different conclusion about the similarity between strain DP3N28-2T and M. alba. Therefore, we identified three features including being slightly curved, negative for nitrate reduction and preferring acidic growth conditions (pH 6.0) as the critical phenotypic differences between DP3N28-2T and M. alba. The detailed physiological and biochemical characteristics of DP3N28-2T are given in Tables 1 and 2, Table S2 and the species descriptions. According to the Biolog GEN III MicroPlate test, DP3N28-2T was susceptible to troleandomycin, nalidixic acid, aztreonam and niaproof 4, and resistant to lincomycin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, rifamycin SV, guanidine HCl and minocycline. Cultures of DP3N28-2T and M. alba CGMCC 1.7290T were grown in MB at 30 °C for 48 h, and then freeze-dried for polar lipid, respiratory quinone and cellular fatty acid composition analysis. The cellular fatty acid composition was measured by the Marine Culture Collection of China (MCCC; Xiamen, Fujian, China) using the Microbial ID system. Respiratory quinones of DP3N28-2T was determined by the MCCC using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry methods. The cellular polar lipids were extracted and determined by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography using silica gel plates (60 F254, Merck). Total lipid material was detected using molybdatophosphoric acid, and specific functional groups were detected using ninhydrin and phosphomolybdenum blue reagents. The respiratory quinone of both strains was Q-10. As shown in Table 2, the two strains showed similar cellular fatty acid profiles, with summed feature 8, C16 : 0 and C18 : 0 as the top three components (&gt;5 %), however, in M. alba CGMCC 1.7290T, the proportion of C18 : 0 was higher than that of C16 : 0, which were consistently shown in all the five representatives of M. alba. As shown in Fig. S2, the polar lipids of DP3N28-2T included phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, one aminophospholipid, one phospholipid and three unidentified lipids. The polar lipid composition was variable among the M. alba strains, but none of them contained phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, which could be used to distinguish DP3N28-2T from M. alba. On the basis of these phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic and genetic data, we propose to classify strain DP3N28-2T as representing a novel species of the genus Mameliella, for which the name Mameliella sediminis sp. nov. is proposed. Mameliella sediminis (se.di’mi.nis L. gen. neut. n. sediminis, of sediment). Cells are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, and non-motile rods (0.5–0.9 µm wide and 1.3–4.7 µm long). Small colonies (1–2 mm) are produced on MA after incubation at 30 °C for 24 h. Colonies are smooth, convex and beige. Growth occurs at 15–45 °C, at pH 5.0–8.0 and in the presence of 0–10 % NaCl; optimal growth occurs at 37–40 °C, at pH 6.0 and in the presence of 4.0 % NaCl. Positive for catalase and oxidase. Negative for nitrate reduction, hydrolysis of gelatin and starch, methyl red test, Voges–Proskauer reaction, and H2S production. Pyruvate are used as sole carbon source, but not citrate. In the API ZYM tests, positive for alkaline phosphatase, esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), lipase (C14), leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, acid phosphatase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and α-galactosidase; negative for trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, α-mannosidase and α-fucosidase. In the API 20NE tests, positive for d-glucose fermentation, urease, β-glucosidase (aesculin hydrolysis) and β-galactosidase; weakly positive for gelatin hydrolysis, utilization of d-glucose, l-arabinose, and d-mannose; negative for reduction of nitrate to nitrite, denitrification, indole production, arginine dihydrolase, utilization of d-mannitol, N-acetyl-glucosamine, maltose, potassium gluconate, capric acid, malic acid, adipic acid, phenylacetic acid and trisodium citrate. According to Biolog GEN III MicroPlate assays, α-hydroxybutyric acid, l-arginine, l-lactic acid, β-hydroxy-d,l-butyric acid, d-fucose, acetoacetic acid and trehalose are oxidized. The polar lipids are phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, one aminophosphlipid, one phospholipid and three unidentified lipids. The main fatty acids are summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω6c and/or C18 : 1ω7c) and C16 : 0. The respiratory quinone is Q-10. The type strain, DP3N28-2T (=MCCC 1K06218T=KCTC 82804T) was isolated from the sediment collected from Daya Bay, Guangdong, PR China. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 63.0 mol % (data from genome sequence). The GenBank accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence and draft genome of strain DP3N28-2T are MZ277401 and JAHUZG000000000 respectively.

Although members of the genera Niabella and Thermomonas are often isolated from similar environmental samples, they belong to the Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, respectively. The genus Niabella is a member of the family Chitinophagaceae. Cells of Niabella species are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-flagellated and short rods. Since the genus Niabella was firstly described by Kim et al., 11 specific names have been validly published (https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/niabella). The names of ‘Niabella terrae’ and ‘Niabella thaonhiensis’ were proposed but have not been validated at the time of this writing. The genus Thermomonas, a member of the family Xanthomonadaceae, was firstly described by Busse et al.. At the time of writing, seven species have been validly published (https://lpsn.dsmz.de/genus/thermomonas). The species of the genera Niabella and Thermomonas have been isolated from a wide range of habitats, and they share features such as cells that are Gram-strain-negative, aerobic and non-flagellated. In this report, we describe two bacterial strains that were isolated from a constructed wetland system, by phylogenetic, physiological, biochemical, and genomic analyses. The constructed wetland system, also called the Dragon-shaped Wetland, located in the central area of the Beijing Olympic Park area (40° 0.2′ N and 116° 22.28′ E), is the largest urban artificial water system in Asia. The water in the Dragon-shaped Water System comes mainly from the Beijing Qinghe Water Reclamation Plant, and the entire water system has a complete circulation system. Sludge samples from the Dragon-shaped Wetland water system were collected, and were serially diluted with 0.85 % NaCl (w/v) and plated onto Reasoner's 2A (R2A) agar (Difco). The isolates, designated as 3A5MI-3T and RSS-23T, were obtained after incubation for 3 days at 30 °C and were routinely stored at −80 °C as suspensions in R2A broth supplemented with 20 % (v/v) glycerol. Genomic DNA was extracted with a commercial TIANamp Bacteria DNA Kit, and 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR with universal bacterial primers 27 F and 1492R, which was also used for sequencing the PCR product. The almost-complete sequence was compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences from GenBank. The 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using ClustalW. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using three phylogenetic algorithms: neighbour-joining, maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed and bootstrapped with 1000 replicates of each sequence using mega version 7.0. The CVTree method was used to reconstruct phylogenomic tree based on whole genomes. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences in GenBank indicated that strain 3A5MI-3T was phylogenetically close to Niabella pedocola R384T (95.97 %), ‘Niabella thaonhiensis’ NHI-24T (95.68 %), Niabella aurantiaca R2A15-11T (95.61 %), Niabella tibetensis 15-4T (95.60 %), Niabella soli JS 13-8T (95.25 %), Niabella drilacis E90T (94.62 %), Niabella hirudinis CCM8411T (94.53 %), Niabella aquatica RP-2T (93.93 %), Niabella yanshanensis CCBAU 05354T (93.76 %), Niabella ginsenosidivorans BS26T (93.51%), ‘Niabella terrae’ ICM 1-15T (92.66 %), Niabella hibiscisoli THG-DN5.5T (92.52 %) and Niabella ginsengisoli GR 10-1T (92.45 %), as well as to Terrimonas rhizosphaerae CR94T (92.14 %) and was &lt;92 % similar to some other species included in this analysis (Fig. 1a and S1, available in the online version of this article). Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis and 16S rRNA gene identity, N. pedocola JCM 31011T was selected as a reference strain for phenotypic tests (see following paragraph). Strain RSS-23T was phylogenetically close to Thermomonas aquatica SY21T (96.99 %), Thermomonas fusca LMG 21737T (96.40 %), Thermomonas brevis LMG 21746T (95.90 %), Thermomonas carbonis GZ436T (95.82 %), Thermomonas haemolytica A50-7-3T (95.75 %), Thermomonas koreensis NBRC 101155T (95.61 %) and Thermomonas hydrothermalis SGM-6T (95.44 %) (16S rRNA gene sequence identities &gt;95 %). The phylogenetic tree showed that the strain grouped with seven members of the genus Thermomonas (Fig. 1b and S2). A phylogenomic tree based on genome sequences also showed the phylogenetic positions of strains 3A5MI-3T (Fig. 2a) and RSS-23T (Fig. 2b). To analyse the genomic properties of strains 3A5MI-3T and RSS-23T, whole-genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina system. The genomic assembly was performed with the SPAdes software (version 3.9.0) using clean data. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were calculated with ChunLab’s online ANI Calculator. Digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) was performed by using the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (3.0). The genome of strain 3A5MI-3T contained three contigs, and the total length was 6.59 Mb, encoding 6358 genes. The calculated DNA G+C content of strain 3A5MI-3T was 47.07 mol%. The genome of strain 3A5MI-3T carries 49 ncRNA genes, including three rRNA operons (5S, 16S, 23S), 41 tRNA genes and five sRNA genes. In addition, there is a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequence (CRISPR) with a length of 2862 bp in this genome. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional category distribution revealed that large numbers of genes in the genome of strain 3A5MI-3T belonged to the metabolism (61 %), genetic information processing (16 %), environmental information processing (7 %) and cellular processes (7 %). Annotated with the RefSeq non-redundant proteins (NR) database, the genomes of strain 3A5MI-3T harboured nine genes encoding phosphohydrolase, nine genes encoding phosphatase, 11 genes encoding glucosidase, 51 genes encoding glycosyl hydrolase families, 36 genes encoding starch binding protein, six genes encoding polysaccharide lyase, seven genes encoding polysaccharide deacetylase, 28 genes encoding SusC/RagA family TonB-linked outer membrane protein, 13 genes encoding xylanase, one gene encoding cellulase and one gene encoding chondroitinase-B. We found genes for xylanase and cellulase in the strain 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM31011T genomes. APIZYM and carbon source utilization experiments confirmed that strain 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM31011T could utilize xylan and cellulose. Although strain 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM31011T both have the chitinase gene in their genome, neither of them can use chitin. Trypsin-like serine proteases were found in the strain 3A5MI-3T genome but not in strain N. pedocola JCM31011T, which corresponds to APIZYM trypsin activity for strain 3A5MI-3T but not for N. pedocola JCM31011T. Comparing the genomes of strain 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM 31011T, we found that the specific genes detected in strain 3A5MI-3T were as follows: four genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein, three genes encoding biotin synthase, three genes encoding CRISPR-associated protein Cas1, two genes encoding 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, one gene encoding bifunctional NAD(P)H-nitrite reductase/anaerobic dehydrogenase, two genes encoding arabinogalactan endo-1,4-beta-galactosidase, three genes encoding TDP-4-oxo-6-deoxy-d-glucose aminotransferase, one gene encoding zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenase family protein, three genes encoding 3-phytase, three genes encoding alpha-glucuronidase and one gene encoding Alg9-like mannosyltransferase family protein. The accession numbers of the sequences in the database relating to the specific or characteristic (marked in yellow) genes of strain 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM 31011T are provided as supplementary material. The ANI value between strains 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM 31011T was calculated using ChunLab’s online ANI Calculator. We performed genome sequencing of N. pedocola JCM31011T and its GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number is JAJNEC000000000. The ANI result was 77.48 %, below the 95 % inter-species threshold. dDDH was performed with genome sequences of strains 3A5MI-3T and N. pedocola JCM 31011T using the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator 29]. The estimated dDDH value was 19.50 %, which was below the standard value generally recommended for species differentiation. The genome of strain RSS-23T contained also three contigs, and the total length is 2.79 Mb, encoding 2575 genes. The calculated genomic DNA G+C content of strain RSS-23T was 61.21 mol%. The genome of strain RSS-23T carries 58 ncRNA genes, including six rRNA genes (5S, 16S, 23S), 49 tRNA genes and three sRNA genes. The KEGG functional category distribution revealed that large numbers of genes in the genome of strain RSS-23T belonged to the metabolism (53 %), genetic information processing (16 %), environmental information processing (14 %), cellular processes (8 %). Annotated with the RefSeq NR database, the genomes of strain RSS-23T harboured 61 genes encoding phosphatase, six genes encoding glucosidase, four genes encoding glycosyl hydrolase, 27 genes encoding glycosyl transferase and 11 genes encoding polysaccharide biosynthesis protein. APIZYM positive enzyme genes such as alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase and α-glucosidase were also found in the genome. Comparing the genomes of strains RSS-23T and T. fusca DSM 15424T, we found that the specific genes contained in strain RSS-23T are as follows: three genes encoding aminotransferase class I/II, six genes encoding chloride channel protein, three genes encoding penicillin acylase, three genes encoding UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, three genes encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase and three genes encoding carbonate dehydratase. The accession numbers of the sequences on the database relating to the specific or characteristic (marked in yellow) genes of strain RSS-23T and T. fusca DSM 15424T are provided as supplementary files. The ANI values between strain RSS-23T and T. fusca DSM 15424T or T. aquatica SY21T were 78.10 and 76.11 %, respectively, which were below the 95 % inter-species threshold. The estimated dDDH values of strain RSS-23T to T. fusca DSM 15424T and T. aquatica SY21T were 25.20 and 20.90 %, respectively, which were below the standard value generally recommended for species differentiation. The morphology and size of cells grown on R2A agar at 30 °C for 2 days were observed by using transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1400, jeol), and motility was observed with light microscopy. Gram-staining was performed according to Hucker. Growth was measured at temperatures of 16, 20, 30, 37,40, 45, 50, 60, 65 and 70 °C. Anaerobic growth was examined in R2A broth without oxygen, and using l-cysteine (1 g l−1) to consume residual oxygen and resazurin (1 mg l−1) as a redox indicator. Salt tolerance was investigated by supplementing NaCl concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.0 % (w/v) to R2A broth. The effect of pH (at pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and 9.0) was tested in R2A broth using phosphate buffer (for pH 5.0–7.0) and Tris buffer (for pH 8.0–9.0). Catalase activity was determined using a 3 % (v/v) hydrogen peroxide solution. Oxidation of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was used to check oxidase activity. Monosaccharide, disaccharide and polysaccharide utilization was tested with the following compounds and basic inorganic salt at concentration of 1 g 1−1: starch, cellulose, chitin, xylan, agar, fructose, galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, glucose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, trehalose, sucrose and sorbose. Bacterial cells grown in R2A were collected and washed three times with basic inorganic salt medium, inoculated at 1 % (v/v), and cultivated for 2 days. Other physiological and biochemical analyses were carried out by using the API ZYM, API 20NE and Biolog GEN III systems, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Cells of strains 3A5MI-3T and RSS-23T were Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, non-motile and short rod-shaped (Fig. S3). The distinctive physiological characteristics of strains 3A5MI-3T and RSS-23T are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The cellular fatty acids were determined using cells grown on R2A agar for 2 days at 30 °C with the standard midi protocol (Sherlock Microbial Identification System, version 6.0B) and analysed with a gas chromatograph (GC6890, Agilent). The extraction, purification and analysis of quinones were carried out according to the methods of Collins et al.. The total lipids were extracted using chloroform and methanol, followed by thin-plate biphasic chromatography to identify each lipid component. Strain 3A5MI-3T contained aliphatic saturated fatty acid (iso-C15 : 0) as its predominant cellular fatty acid that accounted for about half of total fatty acids, followed by iso-C15 : 1 ω6c and/or iso-C15 : 1 ω7c, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 ω7c/C16 : 1 ω6c). The composition of the fatty acids is shown in Table 3. The major cytoquinone was determined to be MK-7, as previously reported for described members of the genus Niabella. The polar lipid profile of strain 3A5MI-3T contained phosphatidylethanolamine and three unknown lipids (Fig. S4a). Strain RSS-23T also contained aliphatic saturated fatty acid (iso-C15 : 0) as its predominant cellular fatty acid, which accounted for about one third of total fatty acids. The fatty acid profiles are shown in Table 4. The major isoprenoid quinone was determined to be Q-8, as previously reported for members of the genus Thermomonas. The polar lipid profile contained diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unknown phospholipids and an unknown lipid (Fig. S4b). Based on the phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, we conclude that strains 3A5MI-3T and RSS-23T represent novel species of the genera Niabella and Thermomonas, respectively, for which the names Niabella beijingensis sp. nov. and Thermomonas beijingensis sp. nov. are proposed. Niabella beijingensis (bei.jing.en’sis. N.L. fem. adj. beijingensis, pertaining to Beijing, the geographical origin of the type strain).

In the published version of the article the proposed name Streptococcus pharyngis is in conflict with rule 53 of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, as it duplicates a subspecific epithet previously validly published for a subspecies of the same genus (Streptococcus constellatus subsp. pharyngis). Therefore, the authors propose the new name Streptococcus cuniculipharyngis sp. nov. and the associated description section is re-printed below:,Streptooccus cuniculipharyngis (cu.ni′cu.li.pha.ryn.gis. L. gen. n. cuniculi of the rabbit; N.L. n. pharynx-yngis (from Gr. n. pharugx, pharuggos) throat; N.L. gen. n. cuniculipharyngis of the throat of a rabbit). Cells are Gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming cocci, 0.5–0.75 mm in diameter, occurring in pairs or chains commonly over 7–12 cells long. Colonies on blood agar are small, circular and non-pigmented, 0.25–0.5 mm in diameter and α-haemolytic at 37 °C after 24 h. Cells are facultatively anaerobic, catalase-negative and non-motile. Reacts with Lancefield group G antisera. Growth occurs at 30, 37 and 42 °C, but not at 4, 15 or 22 °C. Growth does not occur in broth containing 3.5, 4.5 or 6.5% (w/v) NaCl. Cells are not able to produce acid from ribose, mannitol, sorbitol, trehalose, raffinose, sucrose, l-arabinose, d-arabitol, cyclodextrin, glycogen, pullulan, maltose, lactose, melibiose, melezitose, methyl β-d-glucopyranoside or tagatose. Leucine arylamidase, esterase C4, lipase C14 (weak reaction), naphthol-AS-BI-phophohydrolase (weak reaction), acid phosphatase, α-chymotrypsin and glycyl-tryptophan arylamidase activities are detected. No activity is detected for alanine–phenylalanine–proline arylamidase, α-mannosidase, α-fucosidase, esterase lipase C8, valine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, trypsin, β-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, β-galactosidase, α-galactosidase, pyroglutamic acid arylamidase or β-mannosidase. Arginine, hippurate and urea are not hydrolysed and acetoin is not produced. The type strain, DICM10-00796BT (=CECT 8754T=CCUG 66496T), was isolated from the pharynx of a wild rabbit. Three additional strains of the species (DICM10-00793A, DICM10-00795A and DICM10-00803A) were also isolated from the pharynx of wild rabbits. The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused. In the published version of the article the type strain accession number was incorrectly listed as CECT 9981T in the abstract. It should have been listed as CECT 9881T. The abstract should have read:,Strains A31/70T, CCUG 58779 and SD129 were Gram-stain-negative, short rods, motile by one polar flagellum and isolated from clinical specimens in Botswana, Sweden and Spain, respectively. The 16S rRNA sequence similarity values grouped them in the Pseudomonas stutzeri phylogenetic group of species. The DNA G+C content ranged from 65.5 to 65.7 mol%. The strains were characterized phenotypically by the API 20NE and Biolog GEN III tests, and chemotaxonomically by their whole-cell MALDI-TOF MS protein profiles and by their fatty acid contents. The absence of the arginine dihydrolase and the hydrolysis of gelatin differentiated these strains from the closest species, Pseudomonas azotifigens. The major fatty acid contents were summed feature 8 (38.6%), C16 : 0 (22.6%), summed feature 3 (20.5%) and C12 : 0 (8.4%). Multilocus sequence analysis with three housekeeping gene sequences (rpoD, gyrB and 16S rRNA) together with whole-genome comparisons indicated that these strains cluster together in the phylogenetic analysis and their similarity values were lower than the thresholds established for species in the genus Pseudomonas. These results permit us to conclude that strains A31/70T, CCUG 58779 and SD129 belong to a novel species in the genus Pseudomonas for which the name Pseudomonas nosocomialis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A31/70T (=CECT 9881T=CCUG 73638T). The authors apologize for any inconvenience caused. The purpose of this list is to publish in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) those new names and new combinations that were effectively published outside the IJSEM as set forth in Rule 27 of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (2008 Revision). Authors and other individuals wishing to have new names and/or combinations included in future lists should send an electronic copy of the published paper to the IJSEM Editorial Office for confirmation that all of the other requirements for valid publication have been met. It is also a requirement of IJSEM and the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes that authors of new species, new subspecies and new combinations provide evidence that types are deposited in two recognized culture collections in two different countries. It should be noted that the date of valid publication of these new names and combinations is the date of publication of this list, not the date of the original publication of the names and combinations. The authors of the new names and combinations are as given below. Inclusion of a name on these lists validates the publication of the name and thereby makes it available in the nomenclature of prokaryotes. Inclusion of a name on these lists is part of the requirements of valid publication of an effectively published name. Indeed, some of these names may, in time, be shown to be synonyms, or the organisms may be transferred to another genus, thus necessitating the creation of a new combination., This listing of names of prokaryotes published in a previous issue of the IJSEM is provided as a service to bacteriology to assist in the recognition of new names and new combinations. This procedure was proposed by the Judicial Commission. The names given herein are listed according to the Rules of priority (i.e. time and date of publication of the articles on the journal’s platform and the order of valid publication of names in the original articles). The following taxonomic opinions (i.e. the emendation of circumscriptions or the creation of synonyms) cannot be considered as validly published nor, in any other way, approved by the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes and its Judicial Commission.  Based on the guidelines given in Appendix 11 of the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes, a list in the form of a codified record of organisms of the status Candidatus must be kept by the Judicial Commission of the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes in cooperation with the Editorial Board of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) and published in that journal in appropriate intervals. To comply at least in part with the guidelines of Appendix 11, we earlier presented Candidatus List no. 1 that contained an inventory of Candidatus taxa compiled from the literature published until the end of 2018 and Candidatus List no. 2 with names proposed in 2019 and addenda to List no. 1. Below is a record of names of Candidatus taxa proposed in 2020 and addenda to the earlier lists. Like in the earlier Candidatus Lists, we we have suggested corrections for incorrectly formed names. These changes are proposals only, and in many cases alternative corrected names are possible. Entries for these periodic updates can be submitted to the IJSEM editorial office (ijsem@editorialoffice.com). In addition, the List Editors keep searching the literature for new Candidatus names. The table includes genus-level names proposed in the literature only as part of binary species-level names.  The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Prokaryotic Code) deals with the nomenclature of prokaryotes. This may include existing names (the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names) as well as new names and new combinations. In this sense the Code is also dealing indirectly with taxonomic opinions. However, as with most codes of nomenclature there are no mechanisms for formally recording taxonomic opinions that do not involve the creation of new names or new combinations. In particular, it would be desirable for taxonomic opinions resulting from the creation of synonyms or emended descriptions to be made widely available to the public. In 2004, the Editorial Board of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM) agreed unanimously that it was desirable to cover such changes in taxonomic opinions (i.e. the creation of synonyms or the emendation of circumscriptions) previously published outside the IJSEM, and to introduce a List of Changes in Taxonomic Opinion. Scientists wishing to have changes in taxonomic opinion included in future lists should send a PDF file of the relevant publication to the IJSEM Editorial Office or to the Lists Editor. It must be stressed that the date of proposed taxonomic changes is the date of the original publication, not the date of publication of the list. Taxonomic opinions included in the List of Changes in Taxonomic Opinion cannot be considered as validly published nor, in any other way, approved by the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes and its Judicial Commission. The names that are to be used are those that are the ‘correct names’ (in the sense of Principle 6) in the opinion of the bacteriologist, with a given circumscription, position and rank. A particular name, circumscription, position and rank does not have to be adopted in all circumstances. Consequently, the List of Changes in Taxonomic Opinion must be considered as a service to bacteriology and it has no ‘official character’, other than providing a centralized point for registering/indexing such changes in a way that makes them easily accessible to the scientific community. The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest., In 1900, Tissier (11) isolated a gram-negative, anaerobic, nonsporeforming organism from an infant with diarrhea and named the organism Coccobacillus anaerobius perfoetens. In 1905, he isolated the same organism from nursing infants. In 1947, Prévot isolated an identical strain from the cecum of a horse. This strain, CCI, was studied by Sébald in 1962 (10) and was transferred by her to the genus Sphaerophorus as S. perfoetens. Subsequently, the cultures of this strain were lost. On the basis of the published descriptions of this organism, Moore and Holdeman (7) transferred the organism to the genus Fusobacterium as F. perfoetens. Recently, we isolated from the feces of a piglet a strain whose characters agree not only with those in the original description of this organism by Tissier but also with those in subsequent descriptions (5, 8, 11). The purpose of this paper is to update the description of Fusobacterium perfoetens (Tissier) Moore and Holdeman and to designate the neotype strain for it. We are grateful to J. De Ley, Laboratory of Microbiology and Microbial Genetics, State University Gent, Belgium, for advice and assistance and for the determination of the DNA base compositions. We thank L. Servaes for technical assistance rendered during the course of this study. This investigation was supported by a grant of the I.W.O.N.L., Brussels, Belgium. Address reprint requests to: P. Van Assche, University of Gent, Laboratory of Industrial Fermentations, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Coupure links 533, 9000 Gent, Belgium. We recently obtained six isolates from the feces of a 2-week-old normal piglet. The isolates were designated PVA B3/5, PVA B3/6, PVA B3/31, PVA B3/31b, PVA B3/34, and PVA B3/63. One of the isolates, PVA B3/63, was deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rock-ville, Md., under the number 29250. Initial isolation of organisms from fecal material was made by enrichment in regenerated modified Rosenow medium (1). Colonies were picked from solid VL blood medium without selection and were incubated at 37°C in GasPak (BBL) jars using a GasPak H2-CO2 generator for the gaseous phase. Cultures of the isolates were maintained in modified Rosenow medium (1), covered with paraffin, and stored deep-frozen at -20°C. The composition of the medium is as follows: proteose peptone no. 3 (Difco), 10 g; beef extract (Difco), 3 g; NaCl, 5 g; glucose, 2 g; cysteine hydrochloride, 0.3 g; Andrade solution (5% fuchsin), 10 ml; and distilled water, 1,000 ml; the pH was adjusted to 7.2. The medium was distributed in tubes, each containing 0.5 g of frozen beef brain and a piece of marble, and was sterilized at 120°C for 20 min. Most of the biochemical tests were performed in VL base medium (1) to which supplements were added. The medium contained: tryptone (Oxoid), 10 g; NaCl, 5 g; beef extract (Difco), 2 g; yeast extract (Difco), 5 g; cysteine hydrochloride, 0.3 g; agar, 0.5 g; and distilled water, 1,000 ml. For the solid VL blood medium, 0.2% glucose, 2% agar, and 10% defi-brinated horse blood were added to the VL base medium. Cellular morphology was determined by examination of Gram-stained smears (Kopeloff modification) as described by Holdeman and Moore (4). The purity of each culture was checked by aerobic and anaerobic subculture on VL blood agar. Cat-alase production was determined by adding 1 drop of a 3% H2O2 solution to a colony on VL agar without blood, since false-positive results may occur due to the catalase in blood. These tests were performed both immediately after removing cultures from an anaerobic environment (anaerobic jar) and after at least a 1-h exposure to the air. The fermentation reactions were studied in VL base supplemented with a 1% carbon source. All carbohydrates and polyalcohols were membrane-filter sterilized as 10% (wt/vol) solutions and added to the basal medium to give a final concentration of 1%. The results were recorded after 7 days. Nitrate reduction and H2S production tests were performed in VL base supplemented with 5 g of NaNO3 per liter and 2 g of glucose per liter, respectively, and with 0.2 g of FeSO4 per liter and 0.3 g of Na2S2O3 per liter. The presence of nitrite was detected by adding 5 drops of 0.8% sul-fanilic acid in 5 N acetic acid and 5 drops of 0.6% α-naphthylamine in 5 N acetic acid to cultures grown in the above-mentioned medium. A red color indicated the presence of nitrite. H2S production was demonstrated by the blackening of the medium. Indole and NH3 production was determined on VL base by adding Kovac reagent or Nessler solution. Threonine deamination was determined by the method described by Buttiaux et al. (1). The metabolic end products from peptone-yeast extract-glucose (PYG) medium and the production of propionic acid from threonine were detected by gas-liquid chromatography by the methods of Holde-man and Moore (4). Chromatography was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5700 A gas Chromatograph with hydrogen flame detector and with helium as the carrier gas. Peak areas were recorded with a digital integrator (model 3370 A). Stainless-steel columns (length, 1.8 m; outer diameter, ca. 0.3 cm) containing 10% Carbowax on Diatoport W were used. Other operating conditions were: sample size, 3 μl; carrier make-up flow, 60 ml/min; inlet and detector temperature, 250°C; and column temperature isothermal, 120°C. Sample components were tentatively identified by comparison with standard volatile fatty acids and fatty acid methyl esters. For determination of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) base composition, DNA was isolated from strain PVA B3/ 63 by the method of Marmur (6). The percentages of guanine plus cytosine (G+C) in the DNA samples were determined from absorbancy ratios of the DNAs by using a quick method described by De Ley (2). To demonstrate the antibiotic susceptibility of the strains, 6-mm paper disks containing the indicated amounts of antibiotic (susceptibility disks for antibiotics, BBL) were placed on VL blood agar plates streaked with the indicated organism, and these were incubated for 2 days in a GasPak anaerobic jar (BBL). The morphology of the six isolates was found to be exactly the same as that of the strains described by Weinberg et al. (12) and Prévot (8). The isolates were nonspore-forming, gram-negative, nonmotile, short, ovoid rods. The cells measured 0.6 to 0.8 by 0.8 to 1.0 μm; they were oval, never elongated, and occurred singly, in pairs, in chains of no more than three cells, or in irregular masses (Fig. 1) where each cell maintained its own shape. They did not elongate in old cultures but remained oval. The cell measurements were always greater in PYG than in Rosenow broth cultures (Fig. 2). No flagella or capsules were present. Tissier (11) described 48-h-old deep-agar colonies as lenticular and 1 mm in diameter. We also found lenticular colonies which enlarged markedly on continued incubation in VL deep agar (6 g of agar per liter). Surface colonies of isolate PVA B3/63 on horse blood agar were 1 to 2 mm in diameter, circular with an entire edge, raised, and grayish-white to gray. Surface colonies of the other isolates were similar to those of PVA B3/63. However, colonies of some of the isolates were slightly umbonate and had diffuse edges and a slightly mottled or finely granular appearance. As described by Weinberg et al. (12), the earlier isolated strains were obligately anaerobic, did not survive 60°C for 15 min, and lived for at least 1 month at room temperature in different media. Growth in glucose broth cultures was rapid, and a fine sediment, gas, and a fetid odor were produced. Glucose and sucrose were the only carbohydrates fermented; lactose was not fermented. Milk was not coagulated, and indole was not produced. H2S, NH3, and CO2 were produced. Lactic acid and only small amounts of butyric and valeric acids were produced from glucose. Some additional biochemical information was provided in the classification manuals of anaerobic bacteria by Prévot (8) and Prévot et al. (9). These characteristics are included in Table 1, in which also are listed the characteristics of the six isolates. Prévot (8) reported the production of acetic, butyric, valeric, and lactic acids from glucose. However, the metabolic products from glucose as summarized by Moore and Holdeman (5), and based upon literature descriptions by Weinberg et al. (12) and by Prévot et al. (9), are acetic, butyric, and lactic acids. In our laboratory, gas chromatographic analyses revealed, as major products, butyric acid (1 to 2 meq/100 ml), lactic acid (0.6 to 1.3 meq/100 ml), acetic acid (0.1 to 0.6 meq/100 ml), and traces of propionic acid (0.0 to 0.1 meq/100 ml). The amount of acetic acid always was greater in PY (0.5 to 1.5 meq/100 ml) than in PY glucose. We believe that the chromatographic procedures available to us are more reliable than were the earlier distillation procedures used by Tissier and Prévot for the identification of the products. The temperature for optimum growth is about 37°C; strain PVA B3/63 grows well in Rosenow medium at 45°C,but it does not grow at 50°C and grows only sparsely at 25 to 30°C. No growth was observed after aerobic incubation, although cultures on surface-inoculated blood agar plates exposed to the air for 24 h and later incubated in an anaerobic GasPak jar grew very well. The other biochemical characteristics of the six isolates are in good agreement with the characteristics cited in the aforementioned descriptions of this organism. Tissier stated that B. perfoetens fermented only glucose and sucrose. We obtained the same results, although weakly positive reactions were noted with fructose, galactose, trehalose, and mannose. The G+C content of the DNA of S. perfoetens described by Sebald (1962) (10) (chromatographic separation) was 30 mol%. Using a method based upon absorbancy ratios (2), we found a G+C content of 28.2 mol% for strain PVA B3/63. The susceptibilities of the six isolates to a number of antibiotics is given in Table 2. All of the isolates had the same antibiotic susceptibility. They were resistant to penicillins, erythromycin, oleandomycin, bacitracin, vancomycin, kanamycin, and neomycin. They were highly susceptible to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin and moderately susceptible to Colistin, polymyxin, and rifampin. From the data presented in Table 1, it is obvious that the characteristics of PVA B3/63 (ATCC strain 29250) agree not only with those recorded in Tissier’s original description of Coc-cobacillus anaerobius perfoetens (syn.: F. perfoetens) but also with those subsequently described for this species by Weinberg et al. (12), Prévot (8), and Séblad (10). Therefore, we propose strain PVA B3/63 as the neotype strain of Fusobacterium perfoetens (Tissier) Moore and Holdeman.
